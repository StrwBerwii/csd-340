        <h2> The Black Cat, Edgar Allen Poe</h2>
<p>I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not uncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey, and a <span id = "cat.">_______</span></p>

<p>This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black, and <span id = "sagacious">_______</span> to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little <span id = "tinctured">_______</span> with superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious upon this point -- and I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.</p>

<p><span id = "Pluto">_______</span> -- this was the cat's name -- was my favorite pet and playmate. I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following me through the streets.</p>
